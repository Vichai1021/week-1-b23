		<p><strong>Cyberjaya </strong>(a portmanteau of <em>Cyber</em> and <em>Putrajaya</em>) is a city with a science park as the core that forms a key part of the <strong>Multimedia Super Corridor</strong> in <strong>Malaysia</strong>. It is located in <strong>Sepang</strong> District, <strong>Selangor</strong>. <strong>Cyberjaya</strong> is adjacent to, and developed along with <strong>Putrajaya</strong>, Malaysia's government seat. This city aspires to be known as the <strong>Silicon Valley of Malaysia</strong>.</p>

		<p>About 26 km south of downtown <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, <strong>Cyberjaya</strong> is located in the <strong>Sepang </strong> District in southern <strong>Selangor</strong> state, located in the <em>mukim</em> of <em>Dengkil</em>. It is adjacent to the Federal Territory of <strong>Putrajaya</strong>, the government of <strong>Malaysia's</strong> administrative capital.</p>

		<p>Spanning about 28.94 square kilometres (7,000 acres), the town is the nucleus of the <strong>Multimedia Super Corridor</strong> (MSC), now known as <strong>MSC Malaysia</strong>. The site for <strong>Cyberjaya</strong> was primarily undeveloped land consisting of oil palm plantations. It has since seen extensive building activities, including a boutique hotel, numerous commercial buildings, offices for MSC status companies, universities, a community club, and the local council's headquarters.</p>
